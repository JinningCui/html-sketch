# Installation

Install the agent environment as follows:
```bash
conda create -n sketchpad python=3.9

pip install pyautogen==0.2.26
pip install 'pyautogen[jupyter-executor]'
pip install Pillow joblib matplotlib opencv-python numpy gradio gradio_client networkx scipy datasets
```
(if you would like to use ag2, please reference this PR: https://github.com/Yushi-Hu/VisualSketchpad/pull/16)

### LLM backend configuration

The project now supports both:

- API backend: OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
- Local backend: local Qwen model

Recommended setup is via environment variables instead of editing source files directly.

#### Option 1: API backend

```bash
export VISUAL_SKETCHPAD_BACKEND=api
export VISUAL_SKETCHPAD_API_KEY=your_api_key
export VISUAL_SKETCHPAD_API_BASE_URL=https://api.kksj.org/v1
export VISUAL_SKETCHPAD_API_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

You can also keep using `OPENAI_API_KEY` for compatibility.

#### Option 2: Local Qwen backend

```bash
export VISUAL_SKETCHPAD_BACKEND=local
export VISUAL_SKETCHPAD_LOCAL_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct
export VISUAL_SKETCHPAD_LOCAL_DTYPE=auto
export VISUAL_SKETCHPAD_LOCAL_DEVICE_MAP=auto
```

Notes:

- Local text-only tasks can run with a causal Qwen model.
- Local vision tasks require a Qwen-VL checkpoint and a recent `transformers` version with VL support.
- If your local model is text-only and the task contains images, the code now raises a clear error telling you to switch to a multimodal model or API backend.

Above is all it needs for math and geometry tasks.

### Installing vision experts for computer vision tasks

For computer vision tasks, you also need to install the vision experts.
In this code base, each vision expert is a gradio server. You can set them up in other servers, and access them through web link. This allows you to run sketchpad agents on your computer, while all vision models running on another GPU server.
Follow [`vision_experts/installation.md`](https://github.com/Yushi-Hu/VisualSketchpad/blob/main/vision_experts/installation.md) to install and launch all the vision experts.

After the server is launched, please edit the gradio servers link in  [`agent/config.py`](https://github.com/Yushi-Hu/VisualSketchpad/blob/main/agent/config.py). Change the server addresses to yours.
```python
SOM_ADDRESS = "[YOUR SOM SERVER ADDRESS]"
GROUNDING_DINO_ADDRESS = "[YOUR GroundingDINO SERVER ADDRESS]"
DEPTH_ANYTHING_ADDRESS = "[YOUR Depth-Anything SERVER ADDRESS]"
```



# Quick Start

### Data
We preprocessed each task and put them into `tasks`. Each instance in each task has a separate folder. Some tasks are too big, so we put it in this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qtbfI7Q9B7pq-WR20q0-OE6OetJqoitS/view?usp=sharing). Please download, unzip, and put the content in the `tasks` folder.

### Run the agent
See `agent/quick_start_math.py` for a simple example of running the math tasks. As seen, the code is modularized. The key function is `run_agent` in `agent/main.py`, which use the agent to finish a task.
```python
from main import run_agent

# run a example for graph max flow. save the execution trace, answer, and usage summary under outputs/graph_maxflow
run_agent("../tasks/graph_maxflow/5", "../outputs/graph_max_flow", task_type="math", task_name="graph_maxflow")

# run a example for geometry. save the execution trace, answer, and usage summary under outputs/geometry
run_agent("../tasks/geometry/2079", "../outputs/geometry", task_type="geo")
```

After installing and setting up all the gradio servers, you can also try run the vision task agent in `agent/quick_start_vision.py`. The structure is similar:
```python
from main import run_agent

# run a example for vision tasks. save the execution trace to outputs/blink_spatial
run_agent("../tasks/blink_spatial/processed/val_Spatial_Relation_1", "../outputs/blink_spatial", task_type="vision")
```

You can also switch backends directly from Python:

```python
from main import run_agent

run_agent(
    "../tasks/graph_maxflow/5",
    "../outputs/graph_max_flow",
    task_type="math",
    task_name="graph_maxflow",
    backend="local",  # or "api"
    local_model="Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct",
)
```

We put the expected running outputs in `outputs` as reference.

### View agent running traces.
See `record_viewer.ipynb`. It is a good example of how Visual Sketchpad works. Also, it shows how to visualize an agent running trace saved in `output.json`.


# Run a task

If you want to run all the examples in a task. First run the following:
```bash
cd agent

# for example, run blink spatial relation task
python run_task.py --task blink_spatial
```

You can also specify the backend from CLI:

```bash
cd agent

# API mode
python run_task.py --task graph_maxflow --backend api --model gpt-4o

# Local mode
python run_task.py --task graph_maxflow --backend local --local-model Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct
```

`run_task.py` now stores outputs under a model-specific folder automatically:

```text
outputs/<backend>/<sanitized-model-name>/<task>/<instance>/
```

Examples:

```text
outputs/api/gpt-4o/graph_maxflow/5/
outputs/local/Qwen_Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct/graph_maxflow/5/
```

This will run the whole task and save all execution traces to `outputs`. Notice that the task should be one of `"vstar", "blink_viscorr", "blink_semcorr", "blink_depth","blink_jigsaw", "blink_spatial", "mmvp", "geometry", "graph_connectivity", "graph_isomorphism", "graph_maxflow", "math_convexity", "math_parity", "winner_id"`


# Agent Trajectories

To facilitate future research, we also share the agent trajectories we get on all tasks in the paper in this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1NwB9Bbuw-oEVXZhslodbspXEag8lD0wy)。
They have the same format as the examples in `outputs` in this repo.
